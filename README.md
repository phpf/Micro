###Overview

Micro is a minimal "full-stack" framework for small yet complex web applications. While PHP certainly doesn't _need_ another framework ("micro" or otherwise), I found the options currently available either too limited or too prescriptive.

You don't need a degree in computer science to understand Micro. The names used for classes, methods, functions, variables, and constants are meant to clearly convey their meaning (what a concept), so you won't find any `iterateSubInvokable()` or any such nonsense here.
